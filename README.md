## About me
<img src="/me.jpg" width="200">
<p>
    I'm Cong Nguyen. My academic foundation in Business Informatics and Media Informatics at THM paved the way for a fulfilling career in software development. Currently, at Sopra Steria, I'm immersing myself in the expansive world of cloud technologies, acquainting myself with modern tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and the Go programming language.

    Outside of my primary work, I've been navigating the realms of functional programming, finding intrigue in languages such as F# and LISP. This exploration reflects my belief in continuous learning and the power of a growth mindset.

    On a personal note, philosophy holds a special place in my interests. I regularly delve into foundational concepts like logic, and the teachings of Stoicism and Daoism resonate deeply with me, offering a holistic perspective on life's complexities.

    In my community, my association with the voluntary fire brigade stands testament to my dedication to service and the well-being of those around me.

    With an ever-curious spirit, I eagerly anticipate the challenges and learning opportunities that lie ahead, cherishing the journey as much as the destination.

<p> 

    In the intricate world of software development, how often do we pause and reflect on the quality of our code? I'm Cong Nguyen, and I've ventured through both academia and industry, consistently emphasizing the pivotal role of clean coding practices.

    With software complexities on the rise, navigating the maze of "Legacy Code" becomes a common challenge. But there's a roadmap to clarity: the SOLID principles. These guidelines not only aid in creating maintainable code but also ensure it's scalable.

    Yet, Clean Code isn't just about principles. It's a balance between readability, maintainability, and performance. And the programming paradigms we embrace further shape this balance.

    Join me as we delve deeper into the essence of Clean Code, exploring its principles and understanding its lasting impact on software quality. Your journey towards coding excellence begins here.
